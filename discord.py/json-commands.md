# Json Commands

* Add the [json\_commands](https://github.com/NexInfinite/DiscordBotHelp/tree/a3607068536fa4e82d8902c21ed6762dad9ff144/Json%20Commands/json_commands.py) to your project.
* Add `from json_commands import *` or `import json_commands` to your project

This was all written by me for my needs so there can and will be issues. This is only here to cut down time writing the same script out over and over.
